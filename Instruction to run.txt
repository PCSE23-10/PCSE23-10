1.Begin by extracting the contents of the ZIP file using an appropriate
decompression tool.

2. Launch PyCharm, a popular integrated development environment
(IDE) for Python, and proceed to open the project. Specifically,
locate and open the " train_digit_recognizer.py " file within the
project. This file is used to train our system with appropriate MNIST
Dataset.

3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies, namely TensorFlow,
NumPy, PIL (Python Imaging Library), and cv2 (OpenCV), are
installed on your computer. If they are not present, follow the
subsequent steps to install them.

  a. Within PyCharm, navigate to the desired dependencies and
  position your cursor over each one. Next, initiate the
  installation process by clicking on the "Install Package" option.
  
4. Once the installation of each module is complete, click on the "Run"
button in PyCharm to execute the project, initiating its runtime
operation. The outcome of this file execution is our trained model
named " trained_model.h5 " which will be used to recognize the
digits written on canvas.

5. Now, Locate and open the file named "final_gui.py" file within the
project and click on "Run" button in PyCharm to execute the project,
initiating its runtime operation. The Canvas widget will appear
where the user will draw the digits and recognize the number by
clicking on " Recognize Number " button.
